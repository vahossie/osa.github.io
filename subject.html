      There were a variety of subjects taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. These included both the core curriculum and the electives, available from third year forward. In the fifth year, students took the Ordinary Wizarding Level (O.W.L.) exams to determine whether they could achieve a score high enough to continue to N.E.W.T.-level (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test) for the class in the remaining two years.<br><br>
      Some classes, including the core classes, might be dropped in sixth year. Specialised classes such as Alchemy became available in sixth year provided there was sufficient demand.<br><br>
      Even though students couldn't apply for Time-Turners to take more classes than were able to fit in the timetables, a student's head of house was able to suggest a Time-Turner to an individual on very rare occasions.All students did, however, have a choice to drop a course if they became a burden (aside from the essential classes).

   <span>Core Classes</span><br><hr>
   <div class="classes">
      <h3><b>Astronomy</b></h3>
      <p>Astronomy was the only field of study at Hogwarts that had a direct equivalent in the Muggle world. Astronomy classes took place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and were taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involved observations of the night skies with telescopes. Lessons were held every week at midnight, and first years had lessons on Wednesday.Known student homework activities included learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their locations, movements, and environments.</p>

      <h3><b>Charms</b></h3>
      <p>Charms were a type of spells concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties, and hence this class mainly consisted of learning those sorts of spells. Charms classes were described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons were largely practical. Charms was considered a "soft option" by some when picking N.E.W.T.-level classes,</p>

      <h3><b>Dark Arts (core in 1997-1998 only)</b></h3>
      <p>Dark Arts only became a subject and mandatory for all students during the 1997–1998 school year, when it was taught by Amycus Carrow. It replaced Defence Against the Dark Arts that school year.</p>

      <h3><b>Defence Against the Dark Arts</b></h3>
      <p>Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., was the class that taught students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from dark creatures.</p>

      <h3><b>Herbology</b></h3>
      <p>Herbology was the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilise and combat them. There were at least three greenhouses, holding a variety of magical plants of varying degrees of lethality. Herbology was also the subject Neville Longbottom excelled in. He later replaced Professor Pomona Sprout as the Herbology teacher by 2019. The class was considered to be very exhausting.</p>

      <h3><b>History of Magic</b></h3>
      <p>History of Magic was the study of magical history, which was taught by Professor Cuthbert Binns. His lessons were depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They were only lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. Topics had included Goblin Rebellions, Giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy.This was the only class at Hogwarts that was taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed. Many considered this to be the most boring Hogwarts class.</p>

      <h3><b>Potions</b></h3>
      <p>Potions was described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It required the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures. Snape's lessons were depicted as unhappy, oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the castle, whilst Horace Slughorn's, who replaced Severus Snape as Potions Master, was shown as more cheerful and even fun at times. Potions was also a difficult class to achieve an O.W.L. in, as only twelve students from Harry Potter's year managed it. The O.W.L written exam was described as "difficult"</p>

      <h3><b>Transfiguration</b></h3>
      <p>Transfiguration was the art of changing the form or appearance of an object, and hence this was what this class taught. Transfiguration was a theory-based subject, including topics such as "Switching Spells" (altering only a part of some object, such as giving a human rabbit's ears); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely disappear); and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air). It was possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa — Minerva McGonagall, the class's teacher, transfigured her desk into a pig. According to Minerva McGonagall, "Transfiguration is some of the most dangerous magic you will be taught at Hogwarts"</p>

      <h3><b>Third years and up</b></h3>
      <h3><b>Arithmancy</b></h3>
      <p>Arithmancy was a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. It was a favourite subject of Hermione Granger. Arithmancy was reportedly difficult, as it required memorising or working with many charts. It was also an elective course that could be taken by students third year and above. The subject was taught by Professor Septima Vector. It was separated into normal Arithmancy and Advanced Arithmancy Studies</p>
      <h3><b>Care of Magical Creatures</b></h3>
      <p>Care of Magical Creatures was a class which instructed students on how to care for magical beasts. Classes were held outside the castle. In Harry's first two years, the class was taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who then retired "in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs". Dumbledore then recruited the gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid to accept a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties. Although Hagrid was obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he consistently misjudged the risk that the animals he used in his lessons pose to his students, which sometimes resulted in chaos. When Hagrid was absent, his lessons were taken over by Professor Grubbly-Plank, an acquaintance of Dumbledore's.</p>
      <h3><b>Divination</b></h3>
      <p>Divination was the art of predicting the future. Various methods were described, including tea leaves, fire-omens, crystal balls, palmistry, cartomancy (including the reading of conventional playing cards and the tarot), astrology, and dream interpretations. Divination was described by Professor McGonagall as "one of the most imprecise branches of magic". Supporters of the subject claimed that it was an inexact science that required innate gifts like the "Inner Eye". Those opposed claimed that the subject was irrelevant and fraudulent.Harry was first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney, and then later by Firenze after Trelawney was sacked by Dolores Umbridge in Harry's fifth year. In his sixth (and presumably seventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney taught Divination. Divination was considered to be a very tiring class.</p>
      <h3><b>Muggle Studies</b></h3>
      <p>Muggle Studies was a class taught by Charity Burbage, which involved the study of the Muggle (non-magical) culture "from a wizarding point of view". It also included Muggle Art and Muggle Music. The only need for witches and wizards to learn about Muggle ways and means was to ensure they could blend in with Muggles while needing to do so (for example, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). Voldemort murdered Professor Charity Burbage because she portrayed Muggles in a positive light and was opposed to limiting wizardry to only people of pure-blood origins. For the rest of that academic year, Alecto Carrow, a Death Eater, taught Muggle Studies. However, her lessons (which were made compulsory) mainly described Muggles and Muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution.</p>
      <h3><b>Study of Ancient Runes</b></h3>
      <p>The Study of Ancient Runes was a general theoretical subject that studied ancient runic scripts. It was taught by Professor Bathsheda Babbling (c. 1991-?). It was an elective course that could be taken by third-year students and above.</p>

   <span>Sixth and Sevent Year</span><hr>
   <div class="classes">
      <h3><b>Advanced Arithmancy Studies</b></h3>
      <h3><b>Alchemy</b></h3>
      <p>Alchemy was a sort of composite subject between Transfiguration, Potions and Muggle Chemistry, focused roughly on the transmutation of substances into other forms. It was an elective, only offered to NEWT level students if the demand was sufficien.</p>
      <h3><b>Apparation</b></h3>
      <p>Apparition was the magical form of teleportation in the wizarding world. Lessons were optional to those in the sixth and seventh years. In the wizarding world, performing Apparition required a licence and could only be legally performed by people over seventeen years of age. The described reason for the restriction was that Apparition was dangerous if done improperly: insufficient concentration could have led to body parts being left behind in an unfortunate side-effect known as splinching.Although magical enchantments on the Hogwarts Castle and its grounds prevented Apparition and Disapparition there, these protections were temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students to practise Apparition. Wilkie Twycross, a Ministry of Magic Apparition Instructor, offered lessons in Apparition to sixth-years.</p>
