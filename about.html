                <b>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</b>, often shortened to Hogwarts, was the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands. It accepted magical students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrolment. It was a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic.
                <span class="read-more-text">
                    The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.<br><br>Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world, though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the United States.<br><br>Children with magical abilities were enrolled at birth, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age eleven. However, if the child in question was a Muggle-born or a half-blood like Harry Potter with no knowledge of the wizarding world, a staff member from the school visited the child and his or her family in order to inform them of their magical heritage and the existence of the wizarding world.<br><br>The school's motto was <i>Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus (Draco Dormiens Nvnqvam Titillandvs)</i>, which, translated from Latin, means "Never tickle a sleeping dragon".

        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <div class="container">
        	<p><b>Early History</b><br>
        		Hogwarts was founded around 990 A.D. by four of the greatest wizards and witches of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They each represented an aspect of personality that they wanted to bring out in new students.
        		<span class="read-more-text">They also placed certain protective enchantments in place to ensure the well-being of their students, for which reason the castle and grounds had both always been protected with Anti-Apparition Charms. Around the same time, the four founders employed the school's first Caretaker, Hankerton Humble, who would often clash with Peeves, the resident Poltergeist, which he would have in common with every successive caretaker after him in the history of Hogwarts.<br><br><br>
        		Although the four founders cooperated well for a time, however, shortly after founding the school, Slytherin had a falling out with the other founders about blood purity, and wanted to admit only pure-blood students. He felt pure-blooded students deserved to learn magic, and those of other ancestry such as Muggle-borns and half-bloods, were unworthy. The other three founders all disagreed, especially Gryffindor. Slytherin left the school, but not before secretly building the Chamber of Secrets. He foretold that only his own heir would be able to open it once they arrived at the school, and the heir would unleash a murderous basilisk living inside to purge the school of all Muggle-born students. Despite the fact that the founders of Hogwarts were effectively in charge of the school during their time, neither of them held the title of headmaster or headmistress of the school, as that was only used sometime after Slytherin's departure, and held by another wizard, who was the first person to be entrusted the stewardship of Hogwarts Castle and the surrounding grounds after the three remaining founders passed away</span>

        <h1>TYPICAL SCHOOL</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                <b>Term began on 1 September.</b> Students usually reached Hogwarts via the Hogwarts Express, which left Platform 9Â¾ of London's King's Cross Station at 11 a.m. sharp. There seemed to be other ways of entering the school, such as via broomsticks or Floo Powder, or simply Apparating to a nearby location such as Hogsmeade. Missing the Hogwarts Express for any reason was a very serious problem, but would not cost the student points as long as they got there before the term had officially started.
                <span class="read-more-text">
                    The Hogwarts Express brought the students to Hogsmeade station. First years traditionally crossed the Black Lake in boats with the gamekeeper, travelling under an opening in the rocks upon which Hogwarts was built, through a curtain of ivy, and finally into an underground harbour.<br><br>
                    Older students travelled on the road in carriages pulled by Thestrals (invisible to any that haven't witnessed death) to the castle. The Start-of-Term Feast took place in the Great Hall. This feast included the Sorting Ceremony, followed by a few words from the current Headmaster or Headmistress. The banquet started after this, including large quantities of food and drink. The feast was closed with a few more words from the Headmaster or headmistress, including the usual "start-of-term notices".<br><br>
                    After dinner, students were led to their house common room by a prefect. This was a special time for new students to get comfortable with their surroundings, because the next day classes would begin. The class schedules were handed out during breakfast by the Heads of House. After two weeks of classes, the Quidditch team trials and flying lessons for the first years usually occured.
                    Homework was usually assigned to students at the end of classes or at the end of the school term. It was usually completed by students in the Study Hall, Study Area, library, Gryffindor Tower reading room or another common room. A homework planner could be used to help students to keep track of all their homework assignments. Some magical planners also told the students to complete the homework when it was opened. If a student failed to complete the homework or was late in handing it in, they could be given a detention as a punishment<br><br>
                    Hogwarts's school year was structured in a similar way to other non-magical schools and colleges in the UK, with a three-term year punctuated by holidays at Christmas and Easter and bounded by the long summer holiday of nine weeks. Students had the option of staying at Hogwarts for the winter and spring holidays. Those who chose to stay at the castle during the Christmas holidays did not have lessons and attended a feast on Christmas Day. Students also did not have classes the week of Easter, but this was much less enjoyable due to the large amount of work the teachers usually assigned students at this time in preparation for final exams.Other than the breaks and weekends, students did not receive holidays. However, students in the third year and above were allowed to visit Hogsmeade, the local village, occasionally.[43] There were normally four feasts per year: the Start-of-Term Feast at the beginning of the school year, End-of-Term Feast at the end of the school year, and feasts at Hallowe'en and Christmas.[1] Feasts were also called to mark special occasions, such as the beginning of the Triwizard Tournament.<br><br>
                    Classes would proceed normally and the next notable event occurred on the evening of 31 October: the Hallowe'en feast. Decorations included giant pumpkins and flocks of hundreds of bats flying across the halls. The served foods included pumpkin treats, tarts, cakes and all sorts of magical sweets. The Quidditch season started usually with the first Quidditch match in the first weeks of November. In the second week of December, the Deputy Head would take names of those who would stay at Hogwarts over the Christmas holidays. The first term usually ended about a week before Christmas, and most of the students and some of the teachers went home by the school train.<br><br>
                    In the Triwizard Tournament years, the Yule Ball occurred on the evening of Christmas Day, ending at midnight. On 25 December, a Christmas feast was held in the Great Hall. Shortly after 6 January (Epiphany aka Twelfth Night), the Hogwarts Express returned to Hogsmeade; the second term would begin. The exact dates of the beginning of the Easter holidays varied every year. During these holidays, the students could go home. The final exams were held the first week of June and the results came out on the second week. In the evening before the Hogwarts Express went back to London, the End-of-Term Feast was held. The Hogwarts Express returned to London during the third week of June. Some staff and all of the students left Hogwarts for summer holidays.
