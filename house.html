				<p>Houses at Hogwarts were both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year's group of students in the same House shared the same dormitory and many classes. The houses competed throughout the school year, by earning and losing points for behaviour. The House with the most points won the House Cup. Each House also had its own Quidditch team that competed for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup. These two competitions bred rivalries between the Houses, the greatest of which was that between Gryffindor and Slytherin.</p><br>
				<b>Sorting</b><br>
				<p>In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses. When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor took his hat off and each <i>"put some brains"</i> in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose future students for each House. At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat was placed on each new student's head during the Sorting Ceremony.<br>The Sorting Hat announced the House the student was to join. Before beginning the Sorting Ceremony, it sang a short song about the founding of the school and the four Houses; the Sorting Hat's songs were different every year, and the Hat was said to take all year composing the next one (according to Ronald Weasley). Every so often it would sing of mortal peril at the school. The students said that it picked up tips from Dumbledore's office.<br>
				It is unclear if the Sorting Hat tended to place students based on qualities they valued or rather qualities they exhibited. One example of the former is Peter Pettigrew, who was sorted into Gryffindor but ultimately turned out to be quite cowardly, self-serving and corruptible. He may have been placed there because, at the time, he admired strong, brave individuals like James Potter and Sirius Black. Other examples include Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, who despite being stupid and rather lazy, were placed in Slytherin, the House of the cunning and ambitious. They flocked around Draco Malfoy, who they admired and who exhibited the traits of Slytherin. Hermione Granger, while more than clever enough for Ravenclaw, valued courage above all, and was sorted into Gryffindor, a House she said sounded "by far the best".</p>

					<p>Congratulations! I’m Prefect Percy Weasley, and I’m delighted to welcome you to GRYFFINDOR HOUSE. Our emblem is the lion, the bravest of all creatures; our house colors are scarlet and gold, and our common room lies up in Gryffindor Tower.<br><br>
					This is, quite simply, the best house at Hogwarts. It’s where the bravest and boldest end up – for instance: Albus Dumbledore! Yes, Dumbledore himself, the greatest wizard of our time, was a Gryffindor! If that’s not enough for you, I don’t know what is.</p>

Its emblematic animal was the lion, it's representative gemstone was rubies, and its colours were scarlet and gold. Minerva McGonagall was the most recent Head of Gryffindor. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "<i>Nearly Headless Nick</i>", was the House Ghost. The founder of the House was Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor corresponded to the element of fire. The common room was located in one of the highest towers at Hogwarts, the entrance was situated on the seventh floor in the east wing of the castle and was guarded by a portrait of The Fat Lady. She permitted entrance if given the correct password, which was changed numerous times throughout the school year. Famous Gryffindors included Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and Minerva McGonagall. The significant object of Gryffindor was the Sword of Gryffindor. Their motto was "<i>Forti Animo Estote</i>".</p>

					<p>Congratulations! I'm Prefect Gabriel Truman, and I'm delighted to welcome you to HUFFLEPUFF HOUSE. Our emblem is the badger, an animal that is often underestimated, because it lives quietly until attacked, but which, when provoked, can fight off animals much larger than itself, including wolves. <br><br>Our house colours are yellow and black, and our common room lies one floor below the ground.Let's deal with a perennial myth about the place, which is that we’re the least clever house. WRONG. Hufflepuff is certainly the least boastful house, but we’ve produced just as many brilliant witches and wizards as any other.</p>

Our emblem is the eagle, which soars where others cannot climb; our house colors are blue and bronze.<br><br> And our common room is found at the top of Ravenclaw Tower, behind a door with an enchanted knocker.The arched windows set into the walls of our circular common room look down at the school grounds: the lake, the Forbidden Forest, the Quidditch pitch and the Herbology gardens. No other house in the school has such stunning views.</p>

			        	<p><b style="color:#222F5B;">Ravenclaw</b> valued intelligence, knowledge, curiosity, creativity and wit. Its emblematic animal was the eagle, it's representative gemstone was sapphires, and its colours were blue and bronze. The Ravenclaw Head of House in the 1990s was Filius Flitwick. The ghost of Ravenclaw was the Grey Lady, who was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, the House's founder. Ravenclaw corresponded to the element of air. The Ravenclaw common room and dormitories were located in a tower on the west side of the castle. Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, could be answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws included Luna Lovegood, Gilderoy Lockhart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander. The significant object of Ravenclaw was Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem, which was turned into a Horcrux by Tom Riddle.</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>Congratulations! I'm Prefect Gemma Farley, and I'm delighted to welcome you to SLYTHERIN HOUSE. Our emblem is the serpent, the wisest of creatures; our house colours are emerald green and silver. <br><br> And our common room lies behind a concealed entrance down in the dungeons. As you'll see, its windows look out into the depths of the Hogwarts lake. We often see the giant squid swooshing by – and sometimes more interesting creatures. We like to feel that our hangout has the aura of a mysterious, underwater shipwreck.</p>

			        <div class="slytherin">
			        	<p><b style="color:#2A623D;">Slytherin</b> valued ambition, leadership, self-preservation, cunning and resourcefulness and was founded by Salazar Slytherin. Its emblematic animal was the serpent, it's representative gemstone was emeralds, and its colours were emerald green and silver. Professor Horace Slughorn was the Head of Slytherin during the 1997–1998 school year, replacing Severus Snape, who as well replaced Slughorn as Potions Professor when he retired for the first time several years prior. Slytherin had produced the most Death Eaters and Dark Wizards, including Tom Riddle, Bellatrix Lestrange and Lucius Malfoy, for example. But that does not mean that other Houses hadn't produced any; Peter Pettigrew was a Gryffindor, and Quirinus Quirrell was a Ravenclaw.The Bloody Baron was the House ghost. The founder of the House was Salazar Slytherin. Slytherin corresponded roughly to the element of water. The Slytherin dormitories and common room were reached through a bare stone wall in the Dungeons. The Slytherin common room lay beneath the Black Lake. It was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and silver lamps hanging from the ceiling. Famous Slytherins included Merlin, Tom Riddle, Draco Malfoy, and Dolores Umbridge. The significant object of Slytherin was Salazar Slytherin's locket, which was turned into a Horcrux by Tom Riddle.</p>
